            <h2>Interstellar Armada Editor tutorial 01</h2>
            <h1>Getting started</h1>
            <h2>Creating the simplest mission</h2>
            <p>In this step-by-step walkthrough, we will create a one versus one battle between the player and a computer controlled enemy ship.</p>
            <p>During the course of this tutorial, you will learn how to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create a new mission</li>
                <li>set up teams for the mission</li>
                <li>add ships to the mission</li>
                <li>set which ships are controlled by the AI and by the player</li>
                <li>export the mission to file</li>
                <li>load and play the mission from the game</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This tutorial is made for the Interstellar Armada Editor version 0.5.4.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Creating the mission</h3>
                    <p><strong>Click the <span class="ref">New</span> button</strong> in the top left corner.</p>
                    <p>In the popup that appears, <strong>select <em>"missions"</em> as the <span class="ref">Item type</span></strong>, if it is not already selected.</p>
                    <p><strong>Select <em>"none"</em> as the <span class="ref">Copy from</span> value</strong>, as we are going to create a whole new mission from scratch.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enter the name of your mission</strong> into the <span class="ref">Name</span> field. This will determine the name of the file when the mission is exported.</p>
                    <p><strong>Click <span class="ref">Create</span>.</strong></p>
                    <p>At this point you have successfully created a new mission, albeit it is an empty one without any spaceships. In the center, <strong>you should see</strong> the preview of the mission, and <strong>on the right side all the properties that you can edit</strong> to set up the mission. This is what we are going to continue with.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Setting up teams</h3>
                    <p>The most basic mission needs to have two spaceships that are in different teams, so that they are hostile to each other. Before adding the ships, let's set up the two teams.</p>
                    <p>By default, <strong>the <span class="ref">teams</span> property</strong> of the mission <strong>is not set</strong>. <strong>Click on the property</strong> (either its current value (<span class="ref">not set</span>) or the <span class="ref">set</span> button that appears when you hover it) <strong>to set it.</strong></p>
                    <p>The teams list is now set, but so far it is empty. <strong>Click on the <span class="ref">empty list</span> button</strong> to edit it.</p>
                    <p>In the little popup that appears, <strong>click on the <span class="ref">+</span> button</strong> to add a new team.</p>
                    <p>Now we have one team added. This will be the player's team, so <strong>enter <em>"Player's team"</em> in the <span class="ref">name</span> field, and hit enter.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Click on the <span class="ref">+</span> button again</strong> to add a second team for the enemy.</p>
                    <p class="hint">The list editor popup automatically switches to editing the new team when you add one, but you can always select which team you would like to edit using the dropdown at the top of the popup (now showing <span class="ref">2: Team 2</span>).</p>
                    <p><strong>Enter <em>"Enemy team"</em> as the <span class="ref">name</span></strong> for this second team <strong>and hit enter</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Now you have the teams set up. <strong>You can close the list editor by clicking on its button</strong> (now showing <span class="ref">[Player's team, Enemy team]</span> again.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Adding the player</h3>
                    <p>Similar to teams, now we will add the two spaceships. Unlike teams, <strong>the <span class="ref">spacecrafts</span> property</strong> is a required one, so it <strong>is already set to an empty list</strong>. <strong>Click on the <span class="ref">empty list</span> button</strong> to edit the list.</p>
                    <p>In the popup, <strong>click on the <span class="ref">+</span> button</strong> to add the first spaceship.</p>
                    <p class="hint">You will now see a lot of properties show up for the first spacecraft as well as you will see it appear in the middle of the preview (unless you have moved the camera of the preview). Don't worry, we only need a few things set for now, and will cover the rest of the properties in later tutorials.</p>
                    <p>This first spacecraft will be our player, so let's <strong>set its <span class="ref">name</span> to <em>"Player"</em></strong> by entering it in place of <em>Spacecraft 1</em> and hitting enter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Click on the <span class="ref">team</span> property to set it</strong>. It's automatically set to the first team in the mission, which is the <em>"Player's team"</em>, so we are good to go!</p>
                    <p><strong>For the <span class="ref">class</span> property, select <em>"falcon"</em></strong>. You should see the default container changing into a Falcon in the preview as you do.</p>
                    <p><strong>Click the <span class="ref">piloted</span> property to set it</strong>. <strong>A checkbox will appear</strong> next to it. <strong>Tick it</strong> to make this the ship that the player pilots in the mission.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Adding the enemy</h3>
                    <p>Now it's time to add our enemy! <strong>Click the <span class="ref">+</span> button at the top of the spacecraft editor popup</strong> to add a new ship.</p>
                    <p><strong>Name this ship <em>"Enemy"</em></strong> and <strong>set its <span class="ref">team</span> to the <em>"Enemy team"</em></strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>For its <span class="ref">class</span>, choose <em>"wolf"</em>.</strong></p>
                    <p>We need to make this ship piloted by the AI. <strong>Click on the <span class="ref">ai</span> property to set it</strong>. By default, it will be set to <em>"fighter"</em>, which is exactly what we want, since this is a fighter.</p>
                    <p>This enemy is now directly on the top of our player, which is not really ideal. <strong>Click on <span class="ref">position</span> to set it</strong>, and then <strong>set the position to 0, 100, 0</strong> to put the enemy 100 meters in front of the player. You can see in the preview where the enemy will be located. (you need to hit enter or click somewhere outside the number editor after changing the values for the preview to refresh)</p>
                    <p>You might want the enemy to face the player, so <strong>click on <span class="ref">rotations</span></strong> to turn it around. <strong>Click on the <span class="ref">none</span> button</strong> that appears, <strong>then on <span class="ref">+</span></strong> to add a new rotation, then <strong>choose the Z axis and enter 180 degrees</strong> (then hit enter). You should see in the preview the enemy now facing the player.</p>
                    <p>We are now done with setting up the enemy, so you can <strong>close the spacecraft editor popup by clicking its button</strong> (now showing <span class="ref">Spacecraft [2]</span>)</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Exporting the mission</h3>
                    <p>We now have our basic mission fully set up, so it's time to export it!</p>
                    <p><strong>Click on the <span class="ref">Export</span> button</strong> in the top left.</p>
                    <p>The <span class="ref">Item type</span> will be automatically set to <em>"missions"</em> and the <span class="ref">Item</span> to the mission we just created.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enter your name into the <span class="ref">Author</span> field</strong>. Later if you wish to upload a (more interesting) mission to the Mission Hub for other players to try, you will need to use the same name here as for the Mission Hub, and <strong>for privacy reasons I recommend that you do not use your real name</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Click <span class="ref">Export</span></strong>. Your browser should now save a file with your entered mission name.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Playing the mission</h3>
                    <p>If you have successfully exported a mission file, you can play it directly in the game.</p>
                    <p><strong>From the main menu, go to <span class="ref">Single player</span> / <span class="ref">My missions</span>, and click on the <span class="ref">Choose file</span> button.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Select the file that you have saved</strong>. The mission will be loaded and you will see its details.</p>
                    <p><strong>Click <span class="ref">Launch mission</span></strong> as you would with any normal mission to play it!</p>
                </li>
